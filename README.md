My graduation dissertation.

# Abstract

This work describes the hardware implementation of a system capable of compression of digital picture sequences (digital video) into an MPEG2-video compatible data stream. The hardware is implemented using high level (behavioral) synthesis.  Just like RTL synthesis caused a revolution in the early 90s high-level synthesis is changing the pace that digital circuits are designed allowing the design houses to hit the short time-windows of the SoC industry. In the results of this work it will be possible to see that with just one high-level implementation several different hardware architectures could be generated and explored to pick the best result overall. One of this architectures was prototyped in an FPGA to validate the work.
